### Description

The bar chart above depicts the distribution of students across various final grades. The `final_grade` column groups the different academic grades such as 'IP', 'A', 'B', and 'F'. In contrast, the `student_count` column represents the number of students achieving each grade. This visualization highlights that most students received an 'IP' (Incomplete) grade, followed by the 'A', 'B', and finally, the 'F' grade, which had the fewest students.
