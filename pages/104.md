## SQL Query
```sql student_excellence
SELECT DISTINCT 
    s.first_name, 
    s.last_name
FROM "workspace-database"."brighthive_dev_redshift"."students" s
JOIN "workspace-database"."brighthive_dev_redshift"."academic_performance" a
    ON s.student_id = a.student_id
WHERE a.final_grade = 'A';
```

## Visualization Component
<BarChart
    data={student_excellence}
    x=first_name
    y=last_name
    type=grouped
    labels=true
    colorPalette={"#1f77b4"}
/>

This bar chart visualizes the students' academic excellence by showing each student's last name alongside their first name as categories. While typically we'd want more informative data, with the given columns, this chart acknowledges the students' success.
