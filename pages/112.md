The bar chart above displays the distribution of student grades by showing the number of students that received each grade. The predominance of 'IP' (In Progress) grades highlights the ongoing progress of many students. In comparison, a smaller but significant number of students have achieved final grades of 'A', 'B', and 'F'. This visualization allows educators to quickly grasp the overall academic performance and identify areas where support might be needed.
