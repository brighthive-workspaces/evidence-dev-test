## Attendance Bar Chart Visualization for Students

First, we will set up an SQL query to retrieve the list of students and their attendance rates. We assume that there's a `students` table with columns `student_name` and `attendance_rate`.

### SQL Query
```sql student_attendance
SELECT
    student_name,
    attendance_rate
FROM
    students
ORDER BY
    attendance_rate DESC
```

### Markdown Visualization using Evidence.dev
Below, we will visualize the attendance rates using a Bar Chart component to show the students' attendance rates.

<BarChart
    data={student_attendance}
    x=student_name
    y=attendance_rate
    labels=true
    color="#1f77b4"
/>
