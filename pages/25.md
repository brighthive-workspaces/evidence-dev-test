### Deal Value by Industry

This visualization presents a bar chart to display the comparison of deal values across different industries. The chart helps identify which industry currently holds the highest value deals in the negotiation stage.

<BarChart
    data={[
        { "industry": "Finance", "deal_value": 16702.37 },
        { "industry": "Manufacturing", "deal_value": 33720.17 }
    ]}
    x="industry"
    y="deal_value"
    labels={true}
/>

The above bar chart leverages the visual strength of bar charts to compare different categories, in this case, industries. With the numerical data as 'deal_value', spanning the expected magnitude of deals, the chart succinctly indicates the total deal value associated with each industry.

#### Why This Visualization Works

- **Quantitative Comparison:** 'Deal value' is quantitatively displayed enabling quick identification of industries with the highest stakes.
- **Intuitive Interpretation:** The bar chart makes it easy for stakeholders to instantly grasp data relationships and derive actionable insights in the negotiation process.
