# Student Final Grades Distribution

This visualization provides an overview of the distribution of final grades among students. The chart below illustrates how many students received each type of grade, including 'A', 'B', 'F', and 'IP'. This helps in understanding the performance trends and identifying which grades are most and least common.

<BarChart
    data={[
        { "final_grade": "A", "count": 5 },
        { "final_grade": "B", "count": 4 },
        { "final_grade": "F", "count": 1 },
        { "final_grade": "IP", "count": 10 }
    ]}
    x="final_grade"
    y="count"
    labels=true
/>
```

### Explanation

The bar chart effectively highlights the distribution of final grades within the student population. It uses 'final_grade' as the categorical axis and 'count' for the numerical values, showcasing the frequency of each grade received:

- **Grade A**: 5 students
- **Grade B**: 4 students
- **Grade F**: 1 student
- **Grade IP (In Progress)**: 10 students

The labels on the bars display the exact counts, ensuring clarity. This visualization quickly communicates the proportion of students in each grade category, helping educators understand student performance and identify areas where interventions may be necessary.
