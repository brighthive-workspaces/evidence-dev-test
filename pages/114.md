```sql 
SELECT * FROM brighthive_dev_redshift.
```

The requested visualization cannot be created due to unavailable data and the absence of specific columns or data points for analysis. To move forward, please ensure that the data source is accessible and provide the necessary columns and data fields to construct the SQL query and subsequent visualization.

However, if you provide the available schema or data source information, I can assist in formatting the appropriate SQL queries and visualizations according to the Evidence.dev documentation. Please ensure the data is accessible and specify details like categorical or numerical columns, if available, for future visualization tasks.
