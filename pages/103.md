This bar chart visualizes the distribution of students across different final grades, illustrating the academic performance of the students. The dataset shows that the majority of students received an 'IP' grade, followed by 'A', and 'B' grades, with the fewest students receiving an 'F'. This distribution can help educators understand the overall performance and allocate support resources effectively.
