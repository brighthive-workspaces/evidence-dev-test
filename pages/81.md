## SQL Query
```sql categorical_numerical_chart

select
    category_column as category,
    sum(CAST(numerical_column AS FLOAT)) as total_value
from example_table
where some_condition
-- typically date range or specific filter
-- e.g., where date between '2023-01-01' and '2023-12-31'
group by category_column
order by total_value desc;
```

## Evidence.dev Visualization

<BarChart
    data={categorical_numerical_chart}
    x=category
    y=total_value

### Visualization Explanation
The above bar chart visualizes the total numerical value aggregated by each categorical item from the selected column. This type of chart is useful to compare the total contributions of different categories, offering insights into distribution or dominance within the dataset. Appropriate filters and context should be fill in place of the placeholder SQL conditions for meaningful analysis.
