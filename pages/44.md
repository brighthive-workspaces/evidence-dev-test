## Evidence.dev Visualization

Since there is no specific SQL query or data provided for this task, I'm unable to generate a visualization using Evidence.dev components. Typically, a basic structure would include defining an SQL query, followed by applying a visualization component (e.g., AreaChart, BarChart, DataTable) using the data returned by that query.

### Example of Evidence.dev Markdown Structure

```markdown
\<AreaChart
    data={query_name}
    x=x_column_name
    y=y_column_name
/>
```

### SQL Query Template
```sql
select
    categorical_column,
    numerical_column
from data_table
```

### Visualization Integration
Once you have a dataset with the necessary columns, replace `query_name`, `x_column_name`, and `y_column_name` with your specific data query name and column identifiers to visualize your data accordingly.
