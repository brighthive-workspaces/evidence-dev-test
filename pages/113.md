This bar chart visualizes the average final grade for each course based on a numerical scale (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, IP=0). By displaying these averages, we can gain insights into academic performance trends and identify courses wherein students tend to perform better or worse on average. The chart allows for an easy comparison across different courses.
