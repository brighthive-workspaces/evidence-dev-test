### No Data Available

The given task requires a visualization of data using Evidence.dev components. However, the provided sample data is completely empty:

```json
[]
```

### Visualization Context

- **Categorical Column:** Category
- **Numerical Column:** Value
- **Chart Type:** Pie (though not directly supported)


### Visualization Explanation

Given no data available in the sample dataset, we can't create a visualization as it requires at least some data. However, let's consider what we could do with data if hypothetically we had it:

If this dataset included information on students who achieved a specific grade, say 'A', the pie chart would be a suitable choice to visualize the proportion of each grade distribution. However, since we only have a total count of records (20), there is no effective way to visualize a single total using a pie chart without any categorical breakdown.

### Alternate Approach

If we had more detailed data, something like:

```javascript
const data = [
    { "Category": "Total Records", "Value": 20 }
];
```
Even though a pie chart is non-ideal for a sole data point, you could still visualize it as 100% category under the label "Total Records".

### Suggested Markdown

If detailed data were available, you might consider alternate chart types, like a bar chart or a simple indication of the total records in textual format for the current situation.

```markdown
<DataTable
    data={[]}
    rows=10
    search=true
/>
```

### Final Result Explanation:

Without specific student performance categories, any attempt to use graphical means lacks substantive utility. If detailed data per student or grade existed, the visualization could better illustrate variations and distributions of grades, particularly showing the volume of 'A' grade achievers in relation to total records or other grades.
