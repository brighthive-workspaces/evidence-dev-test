# Distribution of Student Grades

The following bar chart illustrates the distribution of final grades among students across various courses in the Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters. The counts represent the number of students who have received each type of grade. This visualization helps identify how many students achieved different levels of academic performance.

<BarChart
    data={[
        { "final_grade": "A", "count": 5 },
        { "final_grade": "B", "count": 4 },
        { "final_grade": "F", "count": 1 },
        { "final_grade": "IP", "count": 10 }
    ]}
    x="final_grade"
    y="count"
    labels=true
/>

This bar chart effectively communicates the distribution of grades, allowing quick comparison of the number of students in each category. Notably, a large number of students have grades marked as 'IP', indicating work still in progress, which might suggest pending assessments or ongoing courses. The chart highlights areas where students excel (Grade A) and areas needing improvement (Grade F).
