### Visualization Component

<BoxPlot
    data={student_gpa_distribution}
    x=major
    y=gpa_points
/>

### Description
This box plot visualizes the distribution of GPA points by major. It showcases the spread and central tendency of GPAs among different academic disciplines, helping to identify variations and outliers in academic performance. Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of GPA points for a specific major, with the line inside the box indicating the median GPA. Outliers are marked as separate points outside the "whiskers" of each box, giving a clear view of any anomalies in the GPA data across majors.
