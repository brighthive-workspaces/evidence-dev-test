### SQL Query for Evidence.dev Visualization
```sql distinguished_students
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM "workspace-database"."brighthive_dev_redshift"."students" s
JOIN "workspace-database"."brighthive_dev_redshift"."academic_performance" a
  ON s.student_id = a.student_id
WHERE a.final_grade = 'A';
```

### Evidence.dev Bar Chart Component
<BarChart
    data={distinguished_students}
    x=first_name
    y=last_name
    swapXY=true
    labels=true
/>

This bar chart displays the first names of students who have achieved a final grade of 'A', emphasizing their distinction in academic excellence. As there is no numerical data, the bars visually represent each student categorically, thereby highlighting their academic achievements.
