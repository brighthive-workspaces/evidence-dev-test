```markdown
<BarChart
    data={[]}
    x="deal_stage"
    y="num_customers"
    labels=true
/>
```

### Explanation

The Bar Chart component is structured to use `deal_stage` as the categorical column on the x-axis and `num_customers` as the numerical column on the y-axis. By toggling `labels` to `true`, the chart will display numerical labels on each bar, which provides a direct view of the number of customers in each deal stage.

This visualization is currently set with an empty data array since the data was not provided. In a real scenario, if data were to be fetched or provided, it would populate the `data` parameter, and the chart would visually compare the stages.

This approach utilizes a bar chart, which is particularly effective for comparing discrete categories (i.e., deal stages) across a dataset, highlighting which stages are thriving or lack engagement based on customer count. Hence, this visualization aligns well with the goal of dissecting customer distributions across different stages.
