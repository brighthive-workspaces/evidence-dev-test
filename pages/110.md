The bar chart above effectively illustrates the distribution of student grades based on the academic performance dataset. With 'final_grade' as the x-axis representing categories such as 'A', 'B', 'IP', and 'F', and 'student_count' as the y-axis, it clearly displays the frequency of each grade. This visualization helps in understanding the overall academic success and distribution among students, marking 'IP' as the most common grade achieved.
