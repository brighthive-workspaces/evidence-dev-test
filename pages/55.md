# Distribution of Student Grades

The bar chart below visualizes the distribution of grades among students based on the provided sample data. The chart helps in understanding the academic performance of students across different grade categories.

<BarChart
    data=[
        {"grade": "A", "count": 5},
        {"grade": "B", "count": 4},
        {"grade": "F", "count": 1},
        {"grade": "IP", "count": 10}
    ]
    x="grade"
    y="count"
    labels=true
/>

## Interpretation and Insights

- **IP Status Prevalence**: The highest number of students (10) currently have an "IP" status, indicating a large number of students are still in progress and have not yet completed their courses.
- **Grade Distribution**: Among completed grades, "A" is the most common grade, with 5 students achieving this level, compared to 4 students earning a "B" and just 1 student receiving an "F".
- **Focus Points**: The low count of students with an "F" indicates either good performance or lenient grading. More analysis might be needed to understand the IP status' outcomes, as it constitutes half the dataset.

This bar chart provides a clear visualization of the current academic achievement trends within the larger dataset of student performance. It enables stakeholders to quickly identify trends and areas that may need further investigation or support interventions.
