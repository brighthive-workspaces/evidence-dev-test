### Bar Chart Visualization
<BarChart
    data={student_grade_distribution}
    x=final_grade
    y=student_count
    labels=true
    
/>

This bar chart visualizes the distribution of students across different final grade categories. Each bar represents the count of students for a particular final grade, making it easy to compare the number of students in each category. This is particularly useful for understanding the performance levels of the student body across grades A, B, IP, and F.
