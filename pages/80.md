No specific tables or columns were provided for creating the SQL query and visualization. However, I will demonstrate a generic approach using a hypothetical dataset with example tables and columns:

#### **Assumed Scenario:**
Given a dataset, I'd illustrate average scores per course.

### **SQL Query Example**
```sql average_scores_per_course
select
    course_id,
    SUM(CAST(score AS FLOAT)) / CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) as average_score
from
    student_results
where
    score IS NOT NULL
group by
    course_id
order by
    average_score desc
```

### **Evidence.dev Visualization**
<BarChart
    data={average_scores_per_course}
    x=course_id
    y=average_score
    labels=true
    yFmt="0.0"
    title="Average Scores per Course"
/>

This example demonstrates how to use a bar chart to visualize average scores (numerical data) for each course (categorical data). Adjust the table name and column names to fit your actual dataset. If further guidance on a real dataset is provided, I can tailor the visualization accordingly.
