### Visualization

<BarChart
    data={mentorship_status_distribution}
    x=mentorship_status
    y=number_of_students
    labels=true
    title="Distribution of Students by Mentorship Status"
/>

Explore how students are categorized based on their involvement in mentorship activities. This visualization can help you understand overall participation levels within the student body, and determine whether a lack of students with an 'A' grade in mentorship is due to small participation rates.
