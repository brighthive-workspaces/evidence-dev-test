### Visualization Summary
This bar chart shows the distribution of students by their final grade categories. From the chart, we can see the number of students who received each grade: 'A', 'B', 'F', and 'IP'. This visualization helps in understanding the overall performance distribution among the students and highlights the significant number of students with grades marked 'IP', indicating they are still in progress, and may need additional attention or follow-up.
