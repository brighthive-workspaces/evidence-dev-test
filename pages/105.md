# SQL Query for Top Performing Students
```sql student_names
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM "workspace-database"."brighthive_dev_redshift"."students" s
JOIN "workspace-database"."brighthive_dev_redshift"."academic_performance" a
  ON s.student_id = a.student_id
WHERE a.final_grade = 'A';
```

# Visualization
Since a pie chart requires numerical data for segments and proportions, we'll use a workaround and represent a bar chart with each distinguished student as a category. This solution visually emphasizes each high-achiever with equal representation, honoring their academic excellence.

<BarChart
    data={student_names}
    x=first_name
    y=yield 1
    labels=true
    colorPalette={"#1f77b4"}
    height=400
/>

This bar chart highlights the distinguished students who earned an 'A' by displaying each of their first names as categories on the x-axis, with equal numerical representation on the y-axis. This effectively showcases their outstanding academic performance in an easy-to-understand manner. Please note that actual pie chart implementation isn't supported due to lack of numerical data to form segments in Evidence.dev.
