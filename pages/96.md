```sql success_by_error
select 
    error, 
    sum(success) as successful_attempts
from retrieval_issues
-- Assuming "retrieval_issues" table contains "error" and "success" columns
-- GROUP BY "error" to aggregate results by type of errors encountered.
group by error
order by successful_attempts desc
```

<BarChart
    data={success_by_error}
    x=error
    y=successful_attempts
    labels=true
    colorPalette={["#FF6347", "#4682B4"]}
/>

The bar chart above shows the number of successful retrieval attempts categorized by error type. If there were no successful retrievals for a certain error, the bar would not be present, clearly indicating the problematic error types impacting data retrieval.
