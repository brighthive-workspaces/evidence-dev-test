## SQL Query to Retrieve Student Grade Counts

```sql student_grade_counts
SELECT 
    a.final_grade AS grade, 
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM 
    brighthive_dev_redshift.students s 
JOIN 
    brighthive_dev_redshift.academic_performance a 
ON 
    s.student_id = a.student_id 
WHERE 
    a.final_grade IN ('IP', 'F')  -- Filter only the grades present in the dataset
GROUP BY 
    a.final_grade
ORDER BY 
    grade;
```
