/>  

This bar chart visualizes the number of performances (`performance_id`) associated with each course (`course_id`) in the dataset. By grouping the performances by course, one can observe how many performance events are linked to each course, giving insights into how often different courses are evaluated or assessed. The `series` configuration is used to ensure that the chart differentiates between courses by using distinct bars for each course, aiding in comparative analysis.
