This bar chart visualizes the distribution of student grades within the dataset. Each bar represents a different grade category ('A', 'B', 'F', 'IP'), and their heights correspond to the number of students who received each grade. By analyzing the chart, you can easily assess how grades are distributed among students and identify any notable patterns, such as the relative frequency of 'IP' grades compared to others.
